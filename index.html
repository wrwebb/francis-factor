            <h2>Road Riding Applications</h2>
            <p>In general, road rides with a Francis Factor lower than 1 are not considered "real rides", whereas road rides with a Francis Factor greater than 1 are considered "real rides".</p>

            <h2>Mountain Bike Riding Applications</h2>
            <p>In general, mtb rides with a Francis Factor lower than 1.25 are not considered "real rides", whereas mtb rides with a Francis Factor greater than 1.25 are considered "real rides".</p>

        <section id="calculation">
            <h2>How To Calculate</h2>
            <p>To calculate the Francis Factor on any given ride, divide vertical feet / miles / 100. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="examples">
            <h2>Example Calculations</h2>
            <p>A 24 mile MTB ride with 3,600 vertical  has a Francis Factor of 1.5 = (3,600 / 24 / 100). This is a "real ride".</p>
            <p>A 55 mile road ride with 6,300 vertical feet of climbing has a Francis Factor of 1.14 = (6,300 / 55 / 100). This is also a "real ride".</p>
            <p>A 34 mile road ride with 1,100 vertical feet of climbing has a Francis Factor of 0.34 = (1,100 / 34 / 100). This is not a "real ride". A ride like this is good reason to step back and ask yourself some hard questions.</p>
